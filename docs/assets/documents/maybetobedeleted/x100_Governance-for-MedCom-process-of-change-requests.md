# Governance for MedCom process of change requests and improvements

Stakeholders and vendors are alway welcome to submit requests for changes or improvements to the IG or other documentation.

Change reuests regarding FHIR Messaging **sHALL** be reported through one of the following channels:

* Zulip notification
* submit an issue to the relevant GitHub repository of the documentation
* write an email to [fhir@medcom.dk](mailto:fhir@medcom.dk) describing the request

<br>

Change requests **SHOULD** be described with:

* a good descriptive headline
* a good reason why
* and be supported by one or more userstories, that states the context of the change

Based on an analysis of the severity of the request, MedCom decides if the changes should be implemented and thus change the version of the artefact or IG to reflect the changes.
